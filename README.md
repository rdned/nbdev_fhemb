## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install nbdev_fhemb in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure nbdev_fhemb package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to nbdev_fhemb
$ nbdev_prepare
```

### CI dependency pins

External CI dependencies are pinned explicitly in both workflow files:

- `.github/workflows/test.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`

Pinned values:

- `FHEMB_TAG`: version/tag of the external `fhemb` wheel.
- `CI_UTILS_COMMIT`: pinned commit of external CI helper scripts.

This project intentionally keeps these pins explicit in workflow `env`
blocks on a self-hosted runner.
